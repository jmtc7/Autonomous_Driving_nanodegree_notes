# Notes of the Self-Driving Car Engineer ND

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repository contains both the **notes and** the **challenges** that I have taken and done during my Self-Driving Car Nanodegree at Udacity. The **big final projects** of each module are in their own independent repositories in my profile (those starting by *CarND-Pm*). However, demos of many of them can be found in the following YouTube playlist:

## Structure

The repository is divided in 3 main sub-folders. Each of them corresponding to one of the nanodegree parts. The **first part** of the course contains formation about Computer Vision, Deep Leaerning and sensor fusion (Kalman filters, EKFs, geometry, etc.). The **second part** focuses on localization, path planning, control and system integration. The last part are **extracurricular materials** (interviews, additional related content, career advice, etc.).

The two main folders are subdivided by modules. All the lessons related to each of the projects that the course involves is considered a *module*. These are the modules of the two main program parts:

- **Part 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning and sensor fusion**
  - **Lane Lines Finding**: Color filters, region of interest, Canny edge detection, and Hough transformation
  - **Advanced Lane Finding**: Camera calibration, perspective transformation, color spaces, gradients, and advanced Computer Vision (sliding windows based on histogram-prior, curvature estimation, and polynomial fitting).
  - **Traffic Sign Classifier**: Neural networks (NNs), ceep NNs, convolutional NNs (CNNs), and TensorFlow.
  - **Behavior Cloning**: Transfer Learning, common CNNs, Keras, and End-to-End CNNs.
  - **Sensor Fusion**: Sensors, Kalman filters (KFs), C++, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Extended KFs (EKFs).
  
- **Part 2: Localization, path planning, control and system integration**
  - **Kidnapped Vehicle**: Markov localization, motion models, and particle filters.
  - **Highway Driving**: Path planning, behavior prediction and planning, and trajectory generation.
  - **PID Control**: Proportional, differential and integral control components, and P, PD and PID controllers. 
  - **System Integration**: Self-driving cars architecture, and ROS for system integration.
