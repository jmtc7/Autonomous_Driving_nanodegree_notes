- Explain your lane detection algorithm. How can it be improved? How does it account for curves and hills? How could you integrate machine learning techniques into the algorithm?
- What are some of the advantages & disadvantages of cameras, lidar and radar? What combination of these (and other sensors) would you use to ensure appropriate and accurate perception of the environment?
- How do features from algorithms like SIFT, SURF and HOG differ? Explain how these algorithms work, and how you would use them within a perception pipeline.
- Explain the technique behind Hough Transforms. Where would this type of feature extraction be useful?
- [Code] What is the RANSAC algorithm? Code the steps that this algorithm takes to help deal with outliers in data. How can we use this algorithm for computer vision?
- Describe the overall process of how a basic Kalman Filter works. Where might a basic Kalman Filter be less than sufficient? How can you improve the basic algorithm to improve performance in such a situation?
- How does an Extended Kalman Filter differ from a regular Kalman Filter? Provide an example of where an EKF would be necessary or an improvement, and detail why it would be needed in that situation.
- What is the difference between an Extended Kalman Filter and an Unscented Kalman Filter? In what situations would there be larger differences between the two approaches?
- [Code] Explain the steps behind how an Extended Kalman Filter is implemented.
- Have you worked with point clouds and/or the Point Cloud Library (PCL) before? If you’ve used PCL before, which modules of PCL did you use, and what application did you use it toward?
- [Code] Describe how a particle filter works, where it is useful, and how it performs against similar algorithms. Code an example of how you update the weights of the particles between steps.
- Your perception subsystem has noticed an object in the path of your robot, but it has failed to determine what the object is. How would your perception subsystem further handle this situation?
- [Code] What approach would you take if the various sensors you are using have different refresh rates?
- [Code] 3D point clouds are sometimes processed into "voxels" as one step into object detection. 1) What is a voxel, 2) What is the process behind converting point cloud data into voxels (code this), and 3) Why would we want to perform this step with our point cloud data?
